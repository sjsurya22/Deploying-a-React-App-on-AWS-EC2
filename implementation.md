**Deploying a React+Vite App on AWS EC2**

This guide will help you deploy your React app on an AWS EC2 instance using Ubuntu.

1️⃣ Launch an EC2 Instance
Go to AWS Console → EC2 → Launch Instance.
Choose an Ubuntu AMI (Ensure it's Free Tier Eligible if using Free Tier).
Select an instance type (e.g., t2.micro for Free Tier).
Create a Key Pair for SSH access.
Configure Security Groups:
Allow HTTP (Port 80) & HTTPS (Port 443) for public access.
Allow SSH (Port 22) for remote login.

2️⃣ Connect to Your EC2 Instance
Once your instance is running, connect via SSH using your key pair:

**ssh -i your-key.pem ubuntu@your-ec2-public-ip**

3️⃣ Set Up the Environment
Update Ubuntu
Run the following command to update system packages:

**sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade -y**

By default, Ubuntu does not have npm installed. Install it using:

**sudo apt install npm -y**

4️⃣ Deploy Your React App
Clone Your Repository

**git clone <your-repository-link>**

Navigate to Your Project Directory

**cd your-project-name**

Install Dependencies

**npm install**

Use --host Flag to Expose Vite Server on EC2

**npm run dev -- --host**

Start the React App

**npm run dev**

5️⃣ Handling EC2 Public IP Changes
By default, AWS assigns a dynamic public IP that changes when the instance is restarted. To keep the same IP:

Attach an Elastic IP (AWS allows only 1 free Elastic IP in Free Tier).
Go to AWS Console → EC2 → Elastic IPs.
Allocate a new Elastic IP and associate it with your EC2 instance.
Now, your app will remain accessible even after a reboot.
